# INFANL01-9 / Secure coding

Name: Secure coding

Code: INFANL01-9

Study load: 3 ECTS / 84 hours (20h contact, 7h homework per week, 4h exam, 4h buffer)

Format: Lectures, labs (150 minutes hoorcollege/werkcollege), homework. Lessons can consist of an overview, a news recap, a Socratic seminar on weekly reading, applied activities, an update on project iterations, a summary, and a reflection.

Prerequisites: INFANL01-6, or permission of the instructor.

Competences: HBO-I 2014 defines security as a quality aspect of all infrastructure layers and development phases. We cover the secure coding bits of ACM/IEEE SE2014.

Objectives: After the course, the student can review source code for security vulnerabilities, apply language-agnostic secure coding principles, and integrate these into the software development lifecycle.

Materials: Software security, ISBN 9780321356703, and other selected reading.

Content: Students are taught how to perform code reviews and how to develop robust code.

Week 1: A history of bugs

Week 2: Code inspection

Week 3: Binary analysis

Week 4: Automated testing

Week 5: Test-driven development

Week 6: Software architecture

Week 7: Threat modelling

Week 8: Security as a process

Assessment: Bug-hunting exam where over half correct is a pass (6), less is a 1. It tests review ability through identifying where exploitable errors exist in the code. Students should participate in pairs in the secure coding assignment, of which students are encouraged to present their product, its underlying process, and peer reviews in week 8 and which can lead to a higher grade. The IEEE Code of Ethics is to be abided by.

Comments: Bring pen, paper, and laptop. Be proactive. Don’t use devices unless asked.
